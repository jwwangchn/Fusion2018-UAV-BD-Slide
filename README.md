## Documentation: 

As of December 13, 2016 I have started to write some theme documentation, which can be viewed as a [Github Wiki](https://github.com/markolsonse/sthlmBeamerTheme/wiki).

## Overleaf:

If you build your decks at Overleaf.com, the theme is available there as well: [https://goo.gl/Z5zrsF](https://goo.gl/Z5zrsF).

## Warning / Disclaimer

I cannot guarantee that the code used to create the sthlm theme is error free nor if it will work in your production environment. If you are curious it has been tested on the following platforms:
- [SageMathCloud.com](https://goo.gl/cvUahe)
- [Overleaf.com](https://goo.gl/nYG3Kq)
- OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 with full installation of MacTeX-2016

sthlm continues to be a theme that can easily modified through the style files without the need for installing a theme package. If you are looking for a packaged theme, then I highly insist that you use mTheme do develop your slide decks. mTheme is still in active development and is available as a latex package with a large user base - it's pretty awesome!
